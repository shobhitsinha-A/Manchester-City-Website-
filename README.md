# About the Project 
The Manchester City Website project is a web development endeavor focused on building a website dedicated to Manchester City Football Club. The project utilizes various libraries and technologies to create a feature-rich and visually appealing platform.

For the frontend, the project incorporates libraries such as Material-UI, providing pre-designed components and a cohesive design system. Additionally, it utilizes Formik and Yup libraries for form management and validation, ensuring smooth user interactions and data integrity.

To handle data storage and retrieval, the project integrates Firebase Database and Firebase Storage, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of various types of data such as match details, news articles, and media assets.

To enhance the user experience, the website employs React Awesome Reveal, a library for creating stunning animations and transitions. The project also utilizes the D3-ease library to create custom animations from scratch, further enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of the website.

With these libraries and technologies, the Manchester City Website project provides a comprehensive and engaging platform for Manchester City fans. Developers interested in web development can explore the project on GitHub, contribute to its features, and leverage the integrated libraries to enhance the website's functionality and design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
